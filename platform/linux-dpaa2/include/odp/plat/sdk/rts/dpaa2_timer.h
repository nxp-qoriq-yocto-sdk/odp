 RTE Timer
 * @brief
 * This library provides a timer service to RTE Data Plane execution
 * units that allows the execution of callback functions asynchronously.
 *
 * - Timers can be periodic or single (one-shot).
 * - The timers can be loaded from one core and executed on another. This has
 *   to be specified in the call to dpaa2_timer_reset().
 * - High precision is possible. NOTE: this depends on the call frequency to
 *   dpaa2_timer_manage() that check the timer expiration for the local core.
 * - If not used in an application, for improved performance, it can be
 *   disabled at compilation time by not calling the dpaa2_timer_manage()
 *   to improve performance.
 *
 * The timer library uses the dpaa2_get_hpet_cycles() function that
 * uses the HPET, when available, to provide a reliable time reference. [HPET
 * routines are provided by EAL, which falls back to using the chip TSC (time-
 * stamp counter) as fallback when HPET is not available]
 *
 * This library provides an interface to add, delete and restart a
 * timer. The API is based on the BSD callout(9) API with a few
 * differences.
 *
 * See the RTE architecture documentation for more information about the
 * design of this library.
