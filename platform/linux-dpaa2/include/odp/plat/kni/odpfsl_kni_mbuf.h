 * @file
 * RTE Mbuf
 *
 * The kbuf library provides the ability to create and destroy buffers
 * that may be used by the RTE application to store message
 * buffers. The message buffers are stored in a mempool, using the
 * RTE mempool library.
 *
 * This library provide an API to allocate/free kbufs, manipulate
 * control message buffer (ctrlmbuf), which are generic message
 * buffers, and packet buffers (pktmbuf), which are used to carry
 * network packets.
 *
 * To understand the concepts of packet buffers or kbufs, you
 * should read "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2: The Implementation,
 * Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-201-63354-X from Richard Stevens"
 * http://www.kohala.com/start/tcpipiv2.html
 *
 * The main modification of this implementation is the use of kbuf for
 * transports other than packets. kbufs can have other types.
